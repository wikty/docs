1. Package Manager: pip

pip is included by default with the Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4


2. Python Version Management: pyenv

pyenv lets you change the global Python version, install multiple Python versions, set directory (project)-specific Python versions

pyenv's plugin pyenv-virtualenv provides features to manage virtualenvs and conda environments for Python on UNIX-like systems

pyenv's plugin pyenv-vritualenvwrapper provides a pyenv virtualenvwrapper command to manage your virtualenvs with virtualenvwrapper


3. Virtual Environments: virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, pyvenv(venv)

virtualenv creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn’t share libraries with other virtualenv environments, so each of application has isolated site-packages

virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to virtualenv.

pyvenv comes with Python standard distribution from version 3.4. There is also a venv module in the standard library


4. Anaconda distribution(data science)

Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

Anaconda is a distribution of Python containing Python, the conda package and environment manager, and many software packages for data analytics, data science, and scientific computing.

Miniconda is a mini version of Anaconda that includes just conda, its dependencies, and Python.
