How to use your token
To make a request to the OpenShift REST API, pass the token as an Authorization header

Authorization: Bearer 22b3069ad0816ab34ba6fcc414d53218ee105e3fca669182151918dc5aef1614
For example, from the command line program cURL use the -H option

curl https://localhost/broker/rest/user -H "Authorization: Bearer 22b3069ad0816ab34ba6fcc414d53218ee105e3fca669182151918dc5aef1614"
You can pass this token directly to the rhc command with the --token option:

rhc apps --token 22b3069ad0816ab34ba6fcc414d53218ee105e3fca669182151918dc5aef1614
