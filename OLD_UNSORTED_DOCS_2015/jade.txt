1, Creating Simple Tags
	Jade is whitespace sensitive, so there's no need to close your tags, jade does that for you. you can also nest tags within other tags just by indenting them(any space)
2, Putting Text inside your tags
	By default, the content of a tag is parsed as more jade. There are three ways to put plain text inside a tag
	1,
		h1  some test text
	2,
		p
			| some test text
			| some test text
	3,
		p.
			some test text
			some test text
3, Adding Attributes to your Tags
	To add attributes you put them in brackets after the tag name , note that they must be separated by a comma
	h1(id="pagetitle",class="title")
4, IDs and Classes
	Adding IDs and Classes is super common, so we made it super easy to do by adding a simple short hand. Tha syntax is just like that of CSS selectors.
	h1#pagetitle.title
5, Javascript
	1,Outputing Text
		you can output raw text from Javscript variables. Jade will also helpfully filter the text for you so it's safe from nasty html injection attacks(if you don't want Jade to filter your output, use != instead of =)
		var jade = require('jade');
		var fn = jade.complie(jadeTemplate);
		var htmlOutput = fn({
			maintainer:{
				name:'wikty',
				site:'wikty.com',
				blog:'blog.wikty.com'
			}
		});
		h1
			| some text
			= maintainer.name
		table
			tr
				tb= maintiner.site
				tb= maintiner.blog
	2,Seting Attributes
		h1(name=maintiner.name)
			| some text
			= maintiner.name
		table
			tr
				td(style='width:'+(100/2)+'%')= maintiner.site
				td(style='width:'+(100/2)+'%')= maintiner.blog
	3,Loop and Conditionals
		You can use if statements to decide what to display depending on variout factors,Jade's if statements are almost exactly like those present in javascript, except the parantheses are optional, and you don't need braces
		if user
  			div.welcomebox
    			// Filtered inline output
    			p.
      				Welcome, #{user.name}
		else	
  			div.loginbox
			    form(name="login", action="/login", method="post")
			      input(type="text", name="user")
			      input(type="password", name="pass")
			      input(type="submit", value="login")
