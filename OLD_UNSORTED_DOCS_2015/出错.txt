1，syntax error, unexpected $end
Situations:
you forgot to close a quote, so PHP is continuing to analyze your code until it finds the closing quotation mark.
You forgot to close a bracket, so from the last opening, PHP considers all the code that follows as part of a block that never ends.
You forgot to close a parenthesis, so from the last open parenthesis, PHP considers all the code that follows as part of a specific block (condition, arguments of functions etc) that does not end.
You forgot a comma, so for PHP there is an instruction in your code that has no end.
or maybe your comment conent have ?>
