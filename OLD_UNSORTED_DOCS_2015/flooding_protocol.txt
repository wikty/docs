What is Flooding?

Flooding is a simple routing algorithm in which every incoming packet is sent 
through every outgoing link except the one it arrived on.


How does Flooding work?

each node acts as both a transmitter and a receiver
echo node tries to forward every message to every one of its neighbours except the source node


RBP: robust broadcast propagation

imporve for Flooding protocol
First, we exploit network density to achieve near-perfect flooding reliability by requiring 
moderate (50-70%) broadcast reliability when nodes have many neighbors. Second, we identify 
areas of sparse connectivity where important links bridge dense clusters of nodes, and strive 
for guaranteed reliability over those links
